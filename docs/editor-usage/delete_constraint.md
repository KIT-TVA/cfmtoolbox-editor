# Notes

**Impact:** Deleting a constraint may affect the validity of your feature model. Ensure that the removal aligns with your model's requirements.

**Undo:** If you accidentally delete a constraint, you can use the Undo option (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z) to restore it.

# Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how the Constraints Panel might look before and after deleting a constraint:

**Before**

``` Shell
Constraints:
1. Feature A (1..1) requires Feature B (1..1)
2. Feature C (0..*) excludes Feature D (1..1)
```

**After Deleting the First Constraint:**
``` Shell
Constraints:
1. Feature C (0..*) excludes Feature D (1..1)
```
