The CFM Toolbox Editor is a core component of the CFM Toolbox, providing a graphical interface for creating, editing,
and visualizing cardinality-based feature models. It is designed to simplify the complexity of working with feature
models while offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The editor is particularly tailored to handle the
intricacies of cardinality-based feature models, making it a powerful tool for researchers, developers, and
practitioners in software product line engineering.

# Key Features of the CFM Toolbox Editor

- **Graphical Creation of Feature Models**: Users can visually design feature models.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: The editor provides a clean and easy-to-navigate interface, making it accessible for
  both beginners ans advanced users.

# Use Cases for the CFM Toolbox Editor

- Research and Education: Researchers and students can use the editor to experiment with cardinality-based feature
  modeling and explore advanced concepts in software engineering.
- Software Product Line Engineering: The editor is ideal for designing and managing feature models for software product
  lines, where variability and commonality need to be explicitly defined.
- Industrial Applications: The editor can be used in industrial settings to model complex systems and manage product
  variability in large-scale projects.
